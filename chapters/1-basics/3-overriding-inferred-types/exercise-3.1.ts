// Exercise 3.1:
// Add explicit type annotations to fix the TypeScript errors

// NOTE: THE CODE HERE IS BAD.
// YOU SHOULD NOT DESIGN YOUR CODE THIS WAY.
// THE ONLY PURPOSE IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
// OVERRIDE INFERRED TYPES.

let a = 10; // Change this line
a = null;

let b = "my string"; // Change this line
b = null;

// ignore the line below
export {};
